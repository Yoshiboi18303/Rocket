- 1. We collect your current guild ID, the prefix for that guild, your user ID, and your warning data.
- 2. We need the guild ID data for custom prefixes, warning roles, etc., and your user ID to provide a profile for you on the bot, and to view your warning data in all guilds you're in.
- 3. In some manners, yes. Your profile data cannot be changed by anyone beside the owner, and your warning context is show to people that run the `warnings` command.
- 4. You can contact the owner in the support server located [here](https://discord.gg/RmwyFgkVTv) if you have any concerns.
- 5. Currently as it stands, we can't delete your data, sorry.

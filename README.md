# About

**`Rocket`** started as **`Rocket-Conomy`**, an idea from the owner (Yoshiboi18303) to test his skills with MongoDB and try using `await` for once. Yoshiboi18303 then started coding the bot, gave it custom prefixes, and a lot of other stuff, he then had a conversation with **`Scorprian`** (the owner of the [Radar Bot Directory](https://radarbotdirectory.xyz)) talking about cpyright issues due to the name and icon, Yoshiboi18303 then went along and fixed those issues and now, **`Rocket`** has blasted off!

## Note from the owner

This bot took a long time to make, and I'm not going to be showing any signs of stopping, so please invite it if you're interested, it'd mean the world to me.
